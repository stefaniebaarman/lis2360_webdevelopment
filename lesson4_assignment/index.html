        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
        <p> Technology, by definition, is the use of machines and devices to provide us with knowledge or services. Technology allows us to have access to unlimited amounts of information. Essentially, technology was created to make things more simple for us humans. Not only does technology help us out in our daily lives, there are many other ways it has changed our generation for the better.
        </p>
        
        <p> First, technology has opened up a whole new door for communication. Even just 10 years ago, the easiest way to communicate with someone was to either send them a letter, which will get to them in 3-5 business days, or go talk to them in person. Now, smart phones have allowed us to send texts or calls to people, even if they are half way across the country, in a matter of seconds. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Next, the evolution of technology has helped us politically because we are able to stay caught up with all of the most recent government issues. Politicians can now advertise their campaigns through websites, the radio, emails, social media, and many more. We are now able to be aware of all of the different issues going on, even in other countries. The rise of social media platforms, such as Twitter, YouTube, and FaceBook, allow us to interact with candidates, easily share news, and fundraise with the click of a mouse. Social media has allowed younger generations to get involved in politics in a modern, entertaining manner.
        </p>
        
        <p> At times, we fail to notice how much technology has transformed our daily lives. Computers went from over-sized, slow functioning desktops to a slim, modern laptop that can fit in your backpack. Technology will continue to evolve in ways that we could have never imagined. The never ending evolution of technology allows us to change the way we do everything.

            <p><em><strong>
                Technology has forever changed the world we live in. We're online, in one way or another, all day long. Our phones and computers have become reflections of our personalities, our interests, and our identities. They hold much that is important to us.
                ~James Comey
